# GReX Software Suite
> Meta package for the entire GReX software suite

This repo serves as organizing all of our different bits of software into one thing you can clone.
As this will use git submodules, this also acts as a way to "version" the complete software stack.

## Installing

Makes sure to clone with `--recurse-submodules`, then run `build.sh`
